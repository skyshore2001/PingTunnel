PingTunnel Changelog
====================

0.72 - 5. September 2011
- Fixes an authentication bug that would manifest as hung connections with
  protocols that send data from the client-side before receiving data from
  the server-side. Thanks to StalkR for locating the bug and fixing it.
- Fixes a crash when attempting to enable packet-capture for non-existing
  network devices. Thanks to Steffen Wendzel for the patch.

0.71 - 22. June 2009
- Added security features and SELinux support, courtesy of Sebastien Raveau.

0.70 - 12. January 2009
- Added rudimentary support for tunneling over udp port 53.
- Added built-in support for compiling on Windows, thanks to Mike Miller.
- Added syslog support, also courtesy of Mike Miller.
- Experimental support for spoofing the source IP address. The source
  address must be explicitly configured in the source code, and it might
  not work (which is why it's experimental). To enable, define
  kPT_add_iphdr to 1.

0.62 - [Never released]
- Added many comments to the ptunnel header file. 
- Moved most include directives to the header file.
- Fixed crash if proxy or destination hostnames could not be looked up.

0.61 - 26. May 2005
- Noted that ptunnel now works without packet capturing on Mac OS X 10.4
  Tiger.
- Log files are now opened in append-mode (i.e., not truncated).
- Fixed a bug that could cause ptunnel to crash if passwords shorter than
  16 characters were used (the overwhelming majority of passwords, most
  likely!).

0.60 - 15. Apr 2005
- Added authentication support, changing parts of the ptunnel protocol.
- Added a manpage.
- Added MD5 implementation by L. Peter Deutsch for authentication.
- Moved declaration of a variable to allow ptunnel to compile cleanly
  on gcc 2.95 - thanks Choong!
- Added error handling for proxy connections.
- Fixed a problem with printing send/recv info. All verbosity levels
  should work now.
- Updated contact info.

0.55 - 18. Feb 2005
- Fixed a locking bug that would manifest itself when the maximum
  connection count on the proxy was reached.
- Fixed ptunnel to compile correctly on 64-bit architectures (thanks
  to Åsmund Grammeltvedt for pointing out the necessary changes!)
- Added a new logging level (level 5). Level 4 no longer outputs send
  and receive info; for this info level 5 is necessary.
- When libpcap is in use, the interface is no longer put in promiscous
  mode. This has never been necessary, and also makes it impossible to
  use ptunnel with more than one client on the same network.
- Discovered a problem with pcap that would cause ptunnel to hang when
  pcap was in use. This problem has not been resolved; the workaround is
  to simply re-execute the client, or disable pcap if possible.
- Added support for specifying a log file on the command line, using
  the -f switch.

0.54 - 1. Feb 2005
- Fixed a byte-order bug (thanks Alfred!)

0.53 - 31. Jan 2005
- Fixed a threading bug, and implemented support for limiting the
  maximum number of tunnels.

Thanks to Alfred Young for reporting and fixing the following bugs:
- Fixed a bug with packets captured via libpcap, where the struct
  sockaddr wasn't properly zeroed.
- Fixed a byte order bug in create_and_insert_proxy_desc.
- Fixed a memory leak in remove_proxy_desc.


0.52 - 3. Jan 2005
- Fixed a problem introduced by the ICMP ID field changes. The 
  proxy didn't retain the ID of the packets received from clients,
  resulting in dropped ICMP packets at the router. This in turn
  lead to the tunnel no longer working, depending on the strictness
  of the router. This version fixes that problem.
- Makefile is better now, thanks to Dries Verachtert.


0.51 - 2. Jan 2005
- Fixed incorrect checksum calculation for resent packets.
- Stopped relying on the ICMP packet's "built-in" ID field,
  and moved the information to the data portion of the packet.
- Changed default verbosity level from debug to verbose.


0.50 - 7. Dec 2004
Initial public release.
